Extension to [the original First to Five](https://github.com/lijenpan/logic/blob/master/first_to_five.md), there is an additional constraint:
> players can only use each number once.

If you follow the other player's strategy, you would pick the numbers in this order:
> [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Which is not as good as my strategy because I did not reveal my probability matrix yet.

It's very clever for Michael Herman to ask this follow-up question to get the math behind my algorithm. You know what? **YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT! Figure this out yourself!**
